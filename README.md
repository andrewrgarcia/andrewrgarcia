### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Dr. Kirk Ziegler's lab](https://ziegler.che.ufl.edu/) at the **University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering** . 

My work focuses on investigating the crystallization of metallic & molecular crystals. I have been developing Monte Carlo simulations to model crystal growth as well as extending the body of knowledge on topics such as the exploration of favorable growth conditions and the determination of three-dimensional morphology and defect formation.

I also have experience working carefully with a wide variety of chemicals and on different lab environments and processes.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Ph.D. dissertation
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about crystal growth, anisotropy, entropy, multi-dimensional arrays, multiprocessing, artificial intelligence, cloud computing. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: My computer is 6 years old :computer: 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email ([on my website](https://thisisandrewgarcia.com/#contact))
