### Hi there 👋

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Dr. Kirk Ziegler's lab](https://ziegler.che.ufl.edu/) at the **University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering** . 

I am investigating the crystallization of metallic & molecular crystals. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Ph.D. dissertation
- 💬 Ask me about crystal growth, chemistry, anisotropy, entropy, cloud computing. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My computer is 6 years old 👨‍💻 👶
- 📫 How to reach me: email ([on my website](https://thisisandrewgarcia.com/#contact))

, doing flame sealing of glassware for lab experiments, setting up separation processes at the lab scale, and running experiments which require a constant influx of heat, both as batch and semi-batch processes. 

I have been modeling crystal growth as well as extending the body of knowledge on topics such as the exploration of favorable growth conditions and the determination of three-dimensional morphology and defect formation.

I also have experience working carefully with a wide variety of chemicals and on different lab environments and processes.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
