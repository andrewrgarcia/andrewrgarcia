### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Dr. Kirk Ziegler's lab at the **University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering** . 

My work focuses on investigating the crystallization of metallic & molecular crystals. I have been developing Monte Carlo simulations to model crystal growth as well as extending the body of knowledge on topics such as the exploration of favorable growth conditions and the determination of three-dimensional morphology and defect formation.

I also have experience working carefully with a wide variety of chemicals, doing flame sealing of glassware for lab experiments, setting up separation processes at the lab scale, and running experiments which require a constant influx of heat, both as batch and semi-batch processes. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Ph.D. dissertation
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about crystal growth, MOFs, three-dimensional stuff, multi-dimensional arrays ('tensors'), machine- and deep-learning, anisotropy, entropy, lattices
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email (on my website)
