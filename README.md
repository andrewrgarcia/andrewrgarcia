### Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. alumnus from [Dr. Kirk Ziegler's lab](https://ziegler.che.ufl.edu/) at the **University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering**. 
I am investigating the crystallization of metallic & molecular crystals. 

- 💬 Ask me about crystal growth, chemistry, anisotropy, entropy, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing.
