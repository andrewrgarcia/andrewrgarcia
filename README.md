### Hi there 👋

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Dr. Kirk Ziegler's lab](https://ziegler.che.ufl.edu/) at the **University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering** . 

I am investigating the crystallization of metallic & molecular crystals. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Ph.D. dissertation
- 💬 Ask me about crystal growth, chemistry, anisotropy, entropy, cloud computing. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My computer is 6 years old 👨‍💻 👶
- 📫 How to reach me: email ([on my website](https://thisisandrewgarcia.com/#contact))
