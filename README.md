### Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. alumnus from [Dr. Kirk Ziegler's lab](https://ziegler.che.ufl.edu/) at the **University of Florida Department of Chemical Engineering**. 
I investigated the crystallization of metallic & molecular crystals, through experiments and theory. I have been implementing higher-order mathematical tensors to model crystal structures and crystallization thereof through stochastic simulations. I have also used artificial intelligence to obtain meaningful information from these tensor representations, as well as used my knowledge on such to expand the field on structure-function relations. 

- 💬 Ask me about crystal growth, chemistry, anisotropy, entropy, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing.
